<h1>Vote in 2014</h1>	

<h2>Election Day: November 4, 2014</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p><strong>We have a crisis in America</strong>: the rates of participation in midterm elections are astonishingly low. People between the ages of 18 and 29 only vote in midterms at about half the rate they vote in presidential elections. <a href="http://www.civicyouth.org/official-youth-turnout-rate-in-2010-was-24/">CIRCLE estimates</a> that fewer than one in four voters age 18 to 29 voted in the 2010 midterm elections.</p>

<p>There exists an enthusiasm gap between presidential and midterm elections among all demographics, but it is particularly noticeable among young voters. Young voters are bombarded with months of messages in presidential election years about the importance of voting. However, in midterms, it is fairly unusual to see a celebrity or cultural element telling you to vote. A presidential election offers a very centralized and prolonged narrative, whereas there are a million different fairly short races in a midterm year.</p>

<p>This enthusiasm gap leads to a common misperception: midterm elections are of far less importance than presidential elections, which is simply not true. Midterm elections are basically just as important as presidential elections when in comes to things that will affect your life.</p>

<p>At stake in this year's elections: the whole of Congress, one-third of the Senate, the governor's offices of 36 states, and 82% of the state legislature seats in the country. From taxes to education, all of these offices make policy with a very real impact on your life.</p>

<p>Our system is by no means perfect—special interests and money have run amok in politics over the past several years—but if only a fraction of citizens vote, those problems will become worse. The current dysfunction in Washington is a result of low voter turnout.</p>

<p>You can think of voting in another way: it’s like going to the dentist. A visit to the dentist might not be something you necessarily want to do, but it will prevent your teeth from turning all discolored and gross. Voting is kind of like routine maintenance on our democracy. Only voting during a presidential election is like only going to the dentist once every four years.</p>

<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>Reduce the enthusiasm gap: commit to voting this year using your Facebook or Twitter account. Share this link to your friends and so on. Instagram or Snapchat photos of your intentions to vote. If puppies eating wedding cake can go viral, why not voting?</p>
