# votein2014.org (Vote in 2014)
This is the very first website I ever built from scratch. I mostly put this on here for archival reasons.

While researching my undergraduate thesis on the history of youth electoral participation in America several years ago, one thing that stuck out to me was the sharp contrast in participation rates between presidential and midterm elections. Although participation goes down across the board in midterms, the drop is even larger among the 18-29 bloc. There is unfortunately an antipathy towards voting outside the presidential elections for many, and it is not uncommon that someone may see a midterm as secondary importance to a presidential election. Additionally, there is only a tiny amount of targeted messaging for young voters in midterms.

With this in mind, I spent one Saturday night creating a small single-page site designed to inform people (particularly those in the 18-29 age group) about what was at stake in the then-upcoming 2014 midterm election, and offering resources with more information.
